# Counting Cards

A standard deck of playing cards has 13 unique cards in each suit.

Task: Given an integer representing the number of cards to pick from the deck, return the number of unique combinations of cards you can pick.

Additional information:
- Order does not matter. Picking card A then card B is the same as picking card B then card A.

For example:
- Given 52, return 1. There's only one combination of 52 cards to pick from a 52 card deck. 
- Given 2, return 1326, There's 1326 card combinations you can end up with when picking 2 cards from the deck.
