# Infected

Task: Given a number of days that have passed since an internet worm was released, and you need to determine how many computers are infected using the following rules:
- On day 0, the first computer is infected.
- Each subsequent day, the number of infected computers doubles.
- Every 3rd day, a patch is applied after the virus spreads and reduces the number of infected computers by 20%. Round the number of patched computers up to the nearest whole number.

Return the number of total infected computers after the given amount of days have passed.
